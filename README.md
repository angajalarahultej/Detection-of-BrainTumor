# Detection-of-BrainTumor
This project focuses on the automatic detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to assist radiologists in early and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely treatment and better patient outcomes.
